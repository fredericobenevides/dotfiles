# Frederico Benevides' Dot Files

Config files to set up my system using Manjaro Linux.

## Installation

Download the dotfiles to the root path and goes to the dotfiles folder

`$ git clone git://github.com/fredericobenevides/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles`

Run with the command:

`./setup.sh`

## Notes about this installation

The installation used to work with Mac OS and Debian system but now is only
tested with Manjaro Linux.

So any improvements I did, new pkgs and fixes are tested for Manjaro.

If you really want to install on your system that is Debian or Mac OS, you may need to do changes...

### To Install on Mac OS

For Mac OS:

Install the xcode from the App Store

**Have Fun**
