# Frederico Benevides Dot Files

Config files to set up my system.

## Instalattion

    git clone git://github.com/fredericobenevides/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ./install.sh

## After installation

The dotfiles don't install a ruby version using rbenv. **You** need manually install.

**NOTE** Xcode 4.2 don't use gcc to compile ruby. You can download in here:

All the configuration will be all setup after opening a new tab or running the following command:
